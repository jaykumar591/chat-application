# Chat Application Key Features

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Handles API routing and middleware for the application.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication between users for messaging.
- **Mongoose**: Object Data Modeling (ODM) for MongoDB.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user details, chat messages, and metadata.
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Secures authentication by generating and verifying tokens.
- **bcrypt**: Encrypts user passwords for secure storage.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Builds dynamic user interfaces for the chat application.
- **TailwindCSS**: Provides utility-first CSS for styling components efficiently.
- **React-Toastify**: Implements toast notifications for real-time feedback (e.g., message sent, error alerts).
- **DaisyUI**: Enhances TailwindCSS with pre-styled UI components for faster development.

### Additional Features
- **Chatbot Integration**: Provides automated responses or support functionality.
- **Cloudinary**: Used for storing and managing multimedia files (e.g., images, videos) uploaded during chat sessions.
